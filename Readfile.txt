git init is used to track every code line in this folder

To remove .git so meaning you git init in the wrong directory, you can remove this with this command line
rm -rf .git

initiating git in the wrong folder means git will track everything in that folder and all your moves from initializing.

This is a problem as we are going to commit codes to github and it will be public. 

use .gitignore to define parameters you do not want git to be able to pull up, or add/commit

To remove or disconnect from a remote repository, you need to do the following: git config -l

This will show you what remote origin you are in

To remove or disconnect from this remote origin enter this command line, git remote remove origin

To ignore files {Example I do not want git to recognize certain files when I pull status or add}
Use this command line.
Vi .gitignore

In vi .gitignore specify what to ignore {example *.py, *.txt, *.html. -- this means any files ending in .py, .txt etc will be ignored}

When you create a repository in GitHub, all you need to do is 
Be in a folder that is not in a git repo.
Git clone <url> {This will create a repo with the name of the online repo name}
Now you can 
Git add
Git commit -m "msg"
Git push -u origin
